`cellular_raza` is a cellular
[agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) framework which focusses
on mechanistically-driven modeling, correctness and customizability.

## Cellular Modeling Mindset
By using `cellular_raza` you, the researcher will be strongly encouraged to follow
mechanistically-driven thought processes.
A good example is modeling the morphogenesis of branching.
One might be able to describe the average length before branching by a simple mathematical
description such as a gaussian distribution around some average value.
While this approach might be effective in describing the underlying system, it gives us not any
additional information about the processes and mechanics which might take place inside the
proliferating cells that make up this structure.
To assess such deep questions, an agent-based model is highly effective as it provides pre-defined
interfaces for rules which can then be directly interpreted as cellular behaviour.

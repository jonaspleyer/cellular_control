# User Guides
All user Guides assume a basic knowledge of the Rust programming language.
To get started with writing Rust please follow the guidance on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org).
For an introduction to agent-based modeling, please refer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) and our current [review](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2022.968409).
There is a wide variety of literature on computational methods.
If you are only getting started without any previous knowledge in computational methods, refer to

## Overview of Guides
| Guide | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Getting Started](UserGuides-GettingStarted.md) | Step-by-step tutorial on how to write, run and visualize your first simulation |
| [Implement your own Concepts](UserGuides-ImplementOwnConcepts.md) | In order to fully take advantage of `cellular_raza`, you can define your own cellular properties and implement them. Learn how to go about this in this guide. |
| [Using Predefined Cellular Modules](UserGuides-PredefinedCellularModules.md) | `cellular_raza` provides some predefined cellular properties. Learn how to use them in your simulation. |
| [Starting from a previous simualtion](UserGuides-StartFromPreviousSimualtion.md) | `cellular_raza` allows to run simulations, stop them and continue running them from the last known savepoint. Learn how you can exploit this functionality. |

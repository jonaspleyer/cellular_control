## Mathematical Description
To model the spatial mechanics of elongated bacteria, we represent them as a collection of points
$\\{\vec{p}\_i\\}$ which are connected by springs with lengths $\\{l_i\\}$.

### Mechanics
The mechanics of each individual bacteria can be described

### Interaction

### Cycle
